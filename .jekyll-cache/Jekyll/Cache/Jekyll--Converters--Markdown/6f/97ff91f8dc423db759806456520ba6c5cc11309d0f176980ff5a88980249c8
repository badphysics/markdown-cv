<strong>Lecturer of Physics - Rochester Institute of Technology</strong></p>

<p>Responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>consulting with program and course administrators and other faculty members, advisory committees.</li>
  <li>defining learning outcomes and evaluating and validating these outcomes</li>
  <li>specifying and approving learning approaches, necessary resources, etc.</li>
  <li>incorporating educational technologies to meet the learning needs of 21st century students.</li>
  <li>Reviewing and revising curriculum and participating in professional development activities.</li>
</ul>

<!-- As a Lecturer in the Department of Physics I taught the following Courses:  
  * ***College Physics 1***: This course is in an algebra based physics course which covers topics on Newton's laws of motion, energy, momentum, rotational dynamics, waves and harmonic motion. I was responsible for running lectures, writing and grading exams and quizzes as well as working with a group of other lecturers to plan curriculum.  
  * ***University Physics 1***: This course is a calculus based physics course which covers topics on Newton's Laws of motion, energy, momentum, rotational dynamics, waves.I was responsible for running lectures, writing and grading exams and quizzes as well as working with a group of other lecturers to plan curriculum.  
  * ***University Physics 2***: This course is a calculus based phyics course with covers topics on electric and magnetic forces and field, electric and magnetic flux, circuts, Maxwell's equations.  
  * ***Introduction to Computational Physics***: This course introduces methods for using computers to model the behavior of physical systems.  Students will learn how computers represent numbers, limits of computation, how to write computer programs, and to use good programming practices.  Students will also apply numerical methods of differentiation and integration, and numerical solutions to differential equations in physical situations.  Responsibilities include maintaining building and maintaining a JupyterHub to host jupyter notebooks for students.  Creating and grading projects.  Running workshops and lectures.  
  * ***Classical Mechanics***: This course is a systematic presentation of Newtonian kinematics and dynamics including equations of motion in one- and three-dimensions, conservation laws, non-inertial reference frames, central forces, Lagrangian mechanics, and rigid body motion. This course will use advanced mathematical techniques including differential equations, vector calculus, and matrix and tensor formulations.
